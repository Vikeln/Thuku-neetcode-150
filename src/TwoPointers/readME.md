- Valid Palindrome - This exercise was checking on handling of two pointers while traversing a string, from the start and from the end


- Two Sum - returning indices such that they add up to a target


- Three Sum - In this problem, the idea is to extract a third number to the two sum problem. We use a linked list that holds lists of values that sum up to the target value. 
The array is also sorted in ascending order to ensure that we skip equal numbers.
